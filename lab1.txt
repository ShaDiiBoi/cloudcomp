    Check Processor Support for Virtualization:
    check if it has Intel VT-x  or AMD-V. You can enable Intel virtualization by going into your computer's BIOS/UEFI settings when you start up (F2, DEL, or ESC) and looking for an option that says "Intel Virtualization Technology." Turn it on if it's off.

    Reasons Behind Cloud Success:
    Pros:
        Scalability: You can easily add or remove resources based on what you need.
        Cost Efficiency: Saves money on physical hardware and maintenance.
        Accessibility: You can access your data and apps from anywhere with the internet.
    Cons:
        Security Concerns: Risk of data theft and losing control over your information.
        Downtime: If your internet goes down, you can't access your services.
        Vendor Lock-In: It can be hard to move your data and services to other providers.

    Primary Function of a Hypervisor:
    A hypervisor's main job is to create and manage virtual machines  by sharing physical resources and ensuring each VM runs separately.

    What is a Virtual Machine?:
        A virtual machine  is a software version of a physical computer that can run its own operating system and programs, just like a real computer.

    Benefits of Using Virtual Machines:
        They help use resources better, keep applications separate, make backups easier, allow testing without extra hardware, and let you run different operating systems on one computer.

    Five Use Cases of Virtual Machines:
        Combining multiple servers into one.
        Creating spaces for developing and testing software.
        Running older applications.
        Preparing for emergencies with backup solutions.
        Creating safe spaces for security checks.

    Guest Operating System:
         The operating system that runs on a virtual machine.

    Virtual Machine Isolation:
         Virtual machines work separately and do not interfere with each other or the main computer.

    Benefit of Virtual Machine Portability:
         It lets you move virtual machines between different physical computers that have compatible hypervisors.

    Purpose of Cloning a Virtual Machine:
        Cloning a virtual machine makes an exact copy of an existing VM, which is helpful for testing, backing up, or quickly setting up similar environments.
